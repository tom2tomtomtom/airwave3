# AIrWAVE Platform Testing Results

## Overview
This document provides the results of testing the AIrWAVE platform prototype. Due to network configuration limitations in the sandbox environment that prevented direct browser access, alternative testing approaches were used to verify the application's functionality.

## Testing Approach
The following methods were used to test the application:
1. Starting the development server locally
2. Verifying server functionality through local HTTP requests
3. Capturing screenshots of key pages using Playwright
4. Examining the application structure and implementation

## Test Results

### Server Functionality
- The development server successfully started on port 3001
- Local HTTP requests to the server returned 200 OK responses
- The server was properly bound to 0.0.0.0:3001, making it accessible on all network interfaces

### Authentication System
The authentication system was tested by capturing screenshots of the following pages:

#### Login Page
![Login Page](/home/ubuntu/airwave/login-page.png)
- The login page displays correctly with:
  - Email and password input fields
  - Login button
  - Links to sign up and reset password

#### Sign Up Page
![Sign Up Page](/home/ubuntu/airwave/signup-page.png)
- The sign up page displays correctly with:
  - Full name input field
  - Email address input field
  - Password input field
  - Sign up button
  - Link to login for existing users

#### Reset Password Page
![Reset Password Page](/home/ubuntu/airwave/reset-password-page.png)
- The reset password page displays correctly with:
  - Email address input field
  - Send reset link button
  - Link back to login page

### Other Functionality
While direct interaction with the application beyond the authentication pages was limited due to the inability to simulate login through Playwright, the code review previously conducted confirmed the implementation of the following features:

1. **Client Management**
   - Client creation with branding colors
   - Client selection and persistence

2. **Asset Management**
   - Asset upload with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Asset gallery with filtering and search
   - Asset tagging and categorization

3. **Template Management**
   - Template import from Creatomate
   - Template gallery with filtering
   - Dynamic field management

4. **Content Generation**
   - Strategic motivation generation
   - Copy variation generation
   - Approval workflow for generated content

5. **Visual Matrix**
   - Matrix creation for organizing content
   - Content organization by platform and format
   - Status management

## Limitations
The following limitations were encountered during testing:
1. Unable to access the application through external browser due to network configuration issues
2. Unable to simulate login and test authenticated pages due to Playwright command limitations
3. Unable to test API endpoints directly due to lack of API documentation

## Conclusion
Based on the testing conducted, the AIrWAVE platform prototype appears to be functioning correctly at the server level and displays the expected authentication interfaces. The application starts successfully, serves pages as expected, and presents well-designed user interfaces for authentication.

The code review previously conducted confirms that the core functionality (client management, asset management, template management, content generation, and visual matrix) is implemented in the codebase, though direct testing of these features was limited by the inability to authenticate through the browser.

The application has a solid foundation with well-implemented authentication interfaces and appears ready for more comprehensive testing in an environment that allows direct browser interaction.
